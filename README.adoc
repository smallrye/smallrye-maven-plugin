= SmallRye Maven Plugin

== About

The SmallRye Maven Plugin is a project which aims to provide some automation that
can be utilized by SmallRye implementation projects in order to perform common
tasks.

== Features

=== Goal: `generate-info`

The `generate-info` goal generates a class in the base package of your project which
gives version information about that project.  The following configuration parameters
are supported:

* `specVersion` (required) - The specification version being implemented
by this project.  In many cases you can directly set this to the value of the property
containing the MicroProfile/Jakarta/etc. spec artifact version.
* `implementationVersion` (required, defaults to `${project.version}`) - The implementation
version.
* `packageName` (required) - The name of the base package into which the class should be generated.
Typically this is something like `io.smallrye.projectname`.
* `className` (required, defaults to `SmallRyeInfo`) - The name of the class to generate.  Normally
this should be left to the default value.
* `sourceOutput` (required, defaults to `${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/smallrye-info`) -
This property determines where the generated sources are written.  The directory named by this
property will automatically be added to the project as a source root.

== Usage

This plugin is intended to be consumed by SmallRye projects (not end user programs).

To include the plugin in a project, add the following plugin definition to the project POM:

.POM snippet
[source,xml]
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
    <artifactId>smallrye-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <!-- add each goal here -->
            </goals>
        <execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <!-- add each configuration item here -->
    </configuration>
</plugin>

See above for information about the available goals and their configuration parameters.

The SmallRye parent POM (https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-parent) should normally be inherited,
which will configure the correct version of this plugin.

=== Example

.POM example
[source,xml]
<plugin>

        <specVersion>${version.eclipse.microprofile.projectname}</specVersion>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
